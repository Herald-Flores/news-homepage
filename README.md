### ðŸš€ Project Structure

Project folders and files:

```text

### ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                    | Action                                           |

| `pnpm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `pnpm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `pnpm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `pnpm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `pnpm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `pnpm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

### What I learned

- Learn how to use Astro 3 framework, use components, ayouts and pages. 
- Implement Taildwind Css with Astro and configure ESLint and prettier for validations and code formatting.
- Mobile First Workflow


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

Astro Layout and Components
```astro
<Header />
<main class='box-border max-w-screen-xl mx-auto mt-2'>
	<slot />
</main>
<Footer />
```

Load Color Theme with JS
```js
if (localStorage.getItem('color-theme') === 'dark' || (!('color-theme' in localStorage) && window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches)) {
	document.documentElement.classList.add('dark')
} else {
	document.documentElement.classList.remove('dark')
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue to practice mobile first and implement good practices in web layout to better adapt the designs to the web.
